<!---
Quick note at the beginning; Great job with grammar throughout the resume!! I see way to many resumes where people don't start their sentences with a verb. In a resume, every sentence should be an action, not an adjective or adverb.

Remove the Data Science Program link unless you have one that you would like to showcase, in which case, you should replace the generic link that is shown above. That one just takes you to a 404 not found page.

## Education


<!---
Instead of saying 'present', I would switch it out for your expected graduation date to let potential employers know

when you are expecting to graduate so they can plan accordingly.

<!---

<!---
Up to you, but I would recommend changing "Full-time missionary" to "Service Missionary" because the term "Service Missionary" is much more universally known compared to "Full-time Missionary" which is really only used within the church. Either way, make sure to capitalize "Missionary"
